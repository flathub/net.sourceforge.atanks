        <p>This is a major new release of Atomic Tanks, the first in five years!
          Several improvements have been made and adjusted with regards to AI aiming.
          We also fixed some crashes, cleaned up some of the building process.</p>
        <p>A new Theft Bomb item has been added, so check out that in the inventory.
          Also AI tanks now start with a basic amount of fuel to help them move about.</p>
